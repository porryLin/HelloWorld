
     * <p>Note that if this method is being called from outside of an
     * {@link android.app.Activity} Context, then the Intent must include
     * the {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK} launch flag.  This is because,
     * without being started from an existing Activity, there is no existing
     * task in which to place the new activity and thus it needs to be placed
     * in its own separate task.

如果不是从Activity 等 Context 里面调用startActivty()方法, 则intent需要包含Flag  "Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK"
   intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
or intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);


News&Weather Quickoffice applications
Once we use temporary GMS Package including Quickoffice .apk and GenieWidget.apk, but replacing with Google Official GMS Package not including these.

Videos has been instead of Play Movies & TV.
If you add other apk at will, I thinks it affects to GMS Certification.

Thank you!


If the proper options are implemented,the hp-printservice.apk must be installed.

 We need the options preinstalled on device, please check this option on Nexus 5, and implement the same vehaviour on Vegeta.
