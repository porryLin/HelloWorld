Hi all,

We have been testing AVRCP/A2DP bluetooth profile with Parrot car MKi9200 kit and it does not work as expected.
It is a erratic behaviour and sometimes works the play/pause button and some times not.
In the other hand, making reference to music titles, they are never displayed on car kit screen.

Please try to solve this issue to next version.

Best regards,
